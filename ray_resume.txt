Projects 											      github.com/Lovjoy      
FEMA NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE POLICIES IN PYTHON				    NOVEMBER 2025
o Processed and cleaned a large FEMA NFIP dataset, addressing substantial missing values, removing duplicates, standardizing inconsistent flood-zone codes, and engineering a binary high-risk vs low-risk flood-zone feature.
o Conducted EDA of policy counts, premium changes by zone and state, and high-risk trends over time.
o Engineered a premium-rate variable and applied a paired t-test comparing Michigan and Florida premium levels within the same broad flood-zone categories.
o Produced visualizations of geographic and temporal trends using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn; managed the workflow in VS Code with version control through GitHub.
BREAST CANCER DIAGNOSTIC CLASSIFICATION IN R					    NOVEMBER 2025
o Built Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, LDA/QDA, KNN, and Decision Tree models; evaluated sensitivity, specificity, AUC, and confusion-matrix performance.
o Tuned probability cutoffs based on confusion-matrix performance to reduce malignant misclassification risk.
o Applied PCA, K-means, and hierarchical clustering to examine data structure and alignment with diagnoses.
o Identified Naïve Bayes as the most clinically safe model (zero false negatives at tuned cutoffs) and KNN as the strongest performer by F1 score.
